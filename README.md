# Mould Cavity Fault Detection System
A project that employs computer vision techniques and industry 4.0 framework to indentify and map manufactring defects to their source, hence reducing wastage and intensive human labour. 

How to setup environment?
1. create python environment by going to prefered directory and using python -m venv .venv
2. enter the environment (use .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1)
3. install all the depencies "pip install -r requirements.txt"
